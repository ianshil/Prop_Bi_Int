# Prop_Bi_Int

Formalisation of foundational results for propositional bi-intuitionistic logics.

More precisely we formalise:
- axiomatic systems for weak and strong bi-intuitionistic logics
- interactions and difference results between the weak and strong system
- the Kripke semantics for bi-intuitionistic logics
- soundness for each system
- completeness via canonical model construction for each system

Note that in various places we use non-constructive arguments via the importation of Classical.

Formalisation by Ian Shillito.

Based on "Bi-Intuitionistic Logics: a New Instance of an Old Problem", a pen-and-paper work by Rajeev Gor√© and Ian Shillito (http://www.aiml.net/volumes/volume13/Gore-Shillito.pdf).
